# Tiger Den
Online ordering system for Tiger Den. The Tiger Den is a cafe shop in Edwardsville High School ran by students with special needs.

[Test Site Here](https://javiermnieto.pythonanywhere.com/)

Made with:

- [Django](https://github.com/django/django)
- [Django-Oscar](https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar)

The ordering system works more as a group ordering system where students place their order requests to their teacher, and the teacher then can review the orders and either place the orders all at once to the Tiger Den where they can fullfill the orders or cancel orders.

Students -> Teacher -> Tiger Den
